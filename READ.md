## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- My motivation for this project was to provide the client with a website that met accessibility standards and was optimized for search engines, as per the ticket request. I refactored the code to present more logically and consolidated for future use, this was accomplished by utilitizng more specific semantic HTML elements, reordering and naming existing elements in sequential order, as well as consolidating redundant code found in the css style file. Throughout this process I was exposed to the difference between workable versus efficient code, and that, while code that works is the first priority and an accomplishment within itself, it can always be improved; this makes the benefits and need for working alonside peers in future projects evident.
